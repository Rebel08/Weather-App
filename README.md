# Getting Started with Create React App
1. After cloning the application make a file with name "apiKey.js" in src folder.

2. Following things are required to write in apiKey.js file:-
        const Api_Key = 'Your API Key';
        export default Api_Key;

  save and close the file.
  
3. Step to get your own API KEY:-

    a. Create your account on Openweathermap.org. If already created then login with your credentials.
    
    b. On right top most corner you able to see your profile name dropdown.
    
    c. Click on profile name dropdown and select "My Api keys".
    
    d. There you find a default Api key use that key or make a new key as per your need.

4. Paste your API KEY in the place of "Your API key" availabe in apiKey.js file with-in single quotation.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
